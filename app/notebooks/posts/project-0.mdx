# Data Visualization with Python

In this project, we explore some basic data visualization techniques using Python. We'll generate and display some sample graphs using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**.

## Introduction

Data visualization is a key step in understanding data. In this project, I used Python to generate sample visualizations to analyze trends and patterns in datasets.

## Python Code Example: Generating a Simple Line Plot

Below is an example of Python code that generates a simple line plot:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Sample data
x = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
y = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]

# Creating the line plot
plt.plot(x, y, label='Linear Growth', color='blue')
plt.xlabel('X-axis')
plt.
```
