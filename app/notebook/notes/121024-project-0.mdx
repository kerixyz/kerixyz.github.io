Welcome to this placeholder entry for **Project 0**! This document demonstrates the use of inline code, block code, and images in MDX files.

## Inline Code Example

Here’s an example of inline code usage:

Use the `console.log()` function to print messages to the console.

You can also format **file paths** as code:
`/notebook/notes/project-0.mdx`

## Block Code Example

Below is an example of a block code snippet:

```javascript
function greet(name) {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
}

greet('World');
```

## Shell Command Example

You can also include shell commands:

```bash
npm install some-package
```
## Image Placeholder

Here’s how you can include an image:

![Placeholder Image](https://via.placeholder.com/800x400?text=Placeholder+Image)

Or reference an image from your local project:

![Local Placeholder](/images/project-0-placeholder.png)

> Make sure to add `/images/project-0-placeholder.png` to your project directory for the second example to work.

## List Example

You can also include lists for organization:
- Step 1: Write your `.mdx` file.
- Step 2: Include inline and block code.
- Step 3: Add images for visual context.
