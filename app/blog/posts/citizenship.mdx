## Getting the Green Card
I immigrated to the United States when I was 13 and had overstayed my visa. As I was finishing my undergraduate studies in 2019, I faced challenges regarding work eligibility. 

In 2018, my family filed an I-130 petition for alien relative through my mom. However, processing times were long, so I sought legal assistance. Through my university’s honors program, I connected with a pro-bono lawyer who introduced me to the Special Immigrant Juvenile (SIJ) case. We submitted the I-360 petition on **2018/11/16**, alongside other forms (I-130, I-485, I-765). Concurrent filing often waives additional fees, so we included all applications together.

On **2018/12/29**, I received my employment authorization card, enabling me to pursue graduate school and full-time employment. My I-360 case was approved on **2019/11/19**, and my green card was mailed on **2019/11/22**.

**Tip:** Use all available resources. Consult university offices, alumni networks, and community organizations. Persistence can lead to unexpected opportunities.

## Getting the Citizenship
The N-400 application process is straightforward for those meeting the 5-year permanent residency requirement. Use USCIS’s [early filing calculator](https://www.uscis.gov/forms/uscis-early-filing-calculator) to determine your earliest filing date.

I submitted my application online on **2024/08/22**. After filing, I received notices via the USCIS portal, including a biometrics reuse notice. My interview was scheduled for **2024/11/20**, but a severe windstorm caused delays. The interview was rescheduled to **2024/11/26**.

At the interview, I clarified discrepancies in my application and completed the reading, writing, and civics tests. After passing, I participated in a same-day oath ceremony and received my naturalization certificate.

**Tip:** Create a myUSCIS account for streamlined communication and application tracking. Note that not all field offices offer same-day interviews and ceremonies.

## Conclusion
Thanks for taking the time to read my journey! I hope this timeline and advice help others navigating the green card and citizenship processes. Feel free to reach out with any questions!
